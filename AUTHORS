A successor to libmbox or 'Virtual MBOX File System'[1] which is in a pre-alpha
build and not been touched since 2005. None of the source code in this project
is in anyway related to 'vfsmail'. There seems to be a libmbox4 [2] however
I have no idea what it does, it's an opaque 'libmbox4.so' file and I don't
quite have the appetite to link against it. Please add your name to the
list :).
